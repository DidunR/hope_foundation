            <p class="our_story_description">
                My name is Eugenia, and I would have never thought I’d register a foundation in Poland … although now,
                looking back, I can surely tell that I have gone a long way to be doing what I’m doing now.
            </p>
            <div class="textContainer" style="display: none;">
                <p class="our_story_description">
                    I was an English teacher for many years for kids and adults, and all the time I was trying to
                    conduct
                    classes
                    using the Bible to draw more people to God through English studies. I’ve had Bible study groups
                    for adults and teenagers for years. I was an operations manager of a beauty salon, where I oversaw a
                    team of 20 women and ran the whole
                    business. I’ve managed social media accounts for several businesses, so I’ve learned a lot about
                    marketing and design. I have three kids, who have taught me unconditional love. …. and now, I have a
                    Ukrainian
                    Community of about 1200 members, - a place with all kinds of meetings, classes, events and various
                    activities.<br><br> It was formed out of the Hope Groups support program, which I
                    was conducting for Ukrainians, who ran away to Krakow, Poland, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine
                    on
                    the 24th of February 2022. At that
                    time, there were few ladies who joined the program, and remained friends after it was over. Soon,
                    this
                    circle of friends got bigger and by Gods’ grace it continues to grow and develop until today. People
                    are
                    coming and providing their feedback that they have found a new family, friends, support and care in
                    our
                    community, which is absolutely motivating for me to keep serving and ministering to people.<br><br>
                    As
                    there
                    were so many creative women coming to our meetings, we’ve started having motivational
                    breakfasts together, dinners with all kinds of themes, theater club, English speaking club, games
                    for
                    teens, fitness classes, art therapy, different activities and workshops for kids, financial
                    awareness
                    meetings, graphic design course, and what’s most close and heart touching to me is our Sunday Bible
                    Study. Most of our community members are single moms, or wives of the soldiers, who are defending
                    Ukraine, and they are starting a new life in a foreign country; people come with traumas after the
                    war
                    and begin
                    their new acquaintances all over again; everyone is so vulnerable and psychologically weak, but we
                    have
                    created a secure space for everyone just not to feel lonely and abandoned, instead get healing and
                    realization, and above all, have the opportunity to find out about Jesus Christ.<br><br> In order to
                    exist as a
                    community legally in Poland, we have registered a foundation. Praise the Lord,
                    the priest of a Catholic church is letting us use the place for free and provided a lawyer, who has
                    helped to gather all the needed documentation for the registration.<br><br> … But, of course, we
                    will
                    need
                    financial support to run all the projects and implement so many more plans and dreams of growing and
                    developing our community.<br><br> If Our Heavenly Father touches your heart with
                    my story, please answer His call and take part in His works in supporting our community. Even a
                    small
                    donation can help us fulfill our plans and my mission:
                    To create a place, where people could grow and develop their better selves and come to understanding
                    and
                    faith in Jesus Christ.

                We’ve started gathering, just four of us: my sister, a girl from Lviv who was looking for a church,
                a
                girl from my group who was looking for God and me. Shortly we had about 20 people coming and a

                    This is absolutely incredible how people, having a thirst for faith and God, come and read Bible
                    for
                    the
                    first time in their lives; how they find out that the Lord is a loving Father, who is just a
                    prayer
                    away, and that prayers are not only learned by heart poems, but a sincere conversation with the
                    Creator
                    of the whole world.<br><br>
                    We decided to study the Bible from the very beginning, as most of the girls haven’t ever read it
                    at
                    all,
                    others have tried but didn’t understand anything. And now we’re reading the New Testament.
                    Everyone
                    takes part in the conversation, sharing their thoughts, experiences and revelations. We all get
                    so
                    filled and inspired that each of us is waiting for Sunday, as the best day of the week.
                    I can surely tell that all of us have grown and changed so much over this year, some of the
                    women
                    have
                    let go of their fears, some have finally opened up and can be safe and sincere in our circle of
                    friends,
                    some became devoted to Christ.<br><br>
                    As the new people coming to our Sunday meeting, I can see we need a bigger room, but we still
                    stay
                    cozy
                    and everyone is engaged even in a bigger circle.
                    Maybe because of the situation of war, migration, loneliness, uncertainty people became more
                    interested
                    in religion, spirituality and vividly have hunger for God - and here am I, full of experience,
                    being
                    Christian for 24 years, ready to share and serve with all my heart and talents.<br><br>
                    Moreover,
                    the
                    Community
                    I’ve created - is an audience I can call on to and easily invite more people to study Bible and
                    get
                    to
                    know the Lord closer. And as Solomon once said: “There is an appointed time for everything,
                    and a time for every affair under the heavens.”<br><br> Ecclesiastes 3:1, I think I’m at the
                    right
                    time
                    and in
                    the right place, so I will definitely serve my Lord!

                    their
                    look perfect and then photographers to make a memory of their beauty and this day. We have also
                    had
                    a
                    buffet and beautiful photozones, and even a little concert of our unreadable talented singers.
                    Everyone
                    was very delighted, maybe also because we had entertained their kids while they were at the
                    party.<br><br>
                    The next year, the situation was more stable and a lot of our members have already settled and
                    got
                    used
                    to life abroad, so we’ve decided to make it a dance night. Besides, we’ve prepared lots of
                    appetizers
                    and desserts, invited men to sing and play the piano and had a lottery time of free coupons for
                    different services from local businesses. It was very nice to gather all those who are with us
                    throughout this year and greet more new people in our community. This is the most valuable time,
                    when we
                    can relax and forget all the troubles of everyday life, feel free and united, and enjoy the
                    moments
                    of
                    happiness.
